# Chondro

Chondro is a prototype library for modeling backgrounds in video sequences. At a high level, chondo can take in a video recorded from a static camera, and produce a per-frame image mask to remove the portion of each frame that corresponds to the "background" of the recorded scene.

The scene "background" is defined as the portion of the scene that remains constant throughout the video clip.

## Requirements
Chondro is written in python and requires [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). There are python bindings for OpenCV available [here](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

Other requirements include:
[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
